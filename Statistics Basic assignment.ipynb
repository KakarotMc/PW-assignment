    "\n",
    "Ans. Measures of central tendency summarize data into a single value that represents the center of the distribution. These measures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The arithmetic average, calculated by summing all data points and dividing by the total number of points. It is best used for symmetric distributions without outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The mean of test scores: (85 + 90 + 95) / 3 = 90.\n",

    "\n",
    "Example: Median house price in a neighborhood to avoid distortion by very expensive or cheap homes.\n",

    "Ans. Dispersion: Refers to the spread or variability of data. It indicates how much the data deviates from the central value.\n",

    "Variance: Measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It gives an idea of the overall data spread but is in squared units of the data.\n",
